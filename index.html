<h2>Introduction about me!</h2>
<p1>I'm Elijah, and I dabble in piano, guitar, drums and all things music related!</p1>

<br/>

<p2>I started playing the guitar about 7 months ago, on the tail end of 2021. This is the story of how i got started.</p2>

<br/>

<p3>I was exposed to music from a young age, joining my school's symphony band at 13 and started learning the keyboard at 14. However, it wasn't until i was 23 did i start to get exposed to the guitar.<br>

I was at a friend's dormitory (in uni) with some of my other classmates just chilling and having some drinks after class. He had a guitar resting against the wall in the back of his room. About several drinks in, we thought it would be a good idea to sing some karaoke but with him playing the guitar. So he picked it up and we had a blast singing songs, ableit brokenly as he wasn't super fluent in it either. Somehow however, just watching him play in real life, (very different from watching a video or concert!) just triggered something in me and I asked if I could have a go at it. That was the first time I every touched a guitar in my life. </p3>
